## üíª How to Run

To run the solutions, you can use a JavaScript runtime like **Node.js** or open the HTML file for browser-based projects.

### Using Node.js
1. Navigate to the specific day and file in the terminal.
2. Run the file:
   ```bash
   node <filename>.js

### Browser
For HTML-based projects (like Day 10's Binary Calculator), open the index.html file in your browser.
